## Introduction

In today's digital age, the use of temporary emails has become increasingly common. While these temporary email services offer convenience for users who want to avoid spam, they pose significant challenges for businesses trying to maintain a clean and active email list. To tackle this issue, we are excited to introduce our **Temporary Email Checker API**.

## What is the Temporary Email Checker API?

Our API is designed to help businesses and developers identify and filter out temporary email addresses from their user database. By integrating our API, you can ensure that the email addresses collected are legitimate and belong to actual users, enhancing the quality of your communication and reducing the risk of email bounces.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Quickly identify temporary email addresses in real-time during user sign-up or form submissions.
- **Comprehensive Database**: Our API uses a continuously updated database of known temporary email providers to ensure accurate detection.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple and flexible integration options for various programming languages and platforms.
- **Detailed Responses**: Receive detailed information about the email address, including its validity and whether it is a known temporary email provider.

## How to Use the Temporary Email Checker API

### Step 1: Get the API URL

```text
https://api.devkraken.com/verify-email
```

### Step 2: Make an API Request

Using your API key, you can make a request to our endpoint. Here is an example using cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.devkraken.com/verify-email \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "test@0-mail.com"}'
```
### Step 3: Interpret the Response

The API will return a JSON response with the status of the email address. Hereâ€™s an example response:

```json
{
	"is_disposable": true,
	"has_mx_records": true,
	"can_receive_email": true,
	"errors": {
		"syntax": null,
		"disposable_email": "Email is from a disposable email provider",
		"mx_records": null,
		"receive_email": null
	},
	"ip_address": "103.224.182.207",
	"domain": "0-mail.com",
	"subdomain": "mail.0-mail.com"
}
```

* `is_disposable`: Indicates if the email is from a disposable email provider.
